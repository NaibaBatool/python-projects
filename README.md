 🧠 Project Overviews

 1. Password Guessing Game  
User selects difficulty (easy/medium/hard), tries guessing a secret word, receives progressive hints revealing correct characters in their correct positions.

 2. Fake News Headline Generator  
Randomly picks from three lists (celebrities, actions, locations) to generate “Breaking News” headlines. Continues until the user chooses to stop.

3. Calculator with History  
Performs basic arithmetic (`+ – * /`) with input like `7 + 3`. Saves each calculation to `history.txt`. Commands include:
- `history` → view previous calculations  
- `clear` → delete history  
- `exit` → quit the calculator.
